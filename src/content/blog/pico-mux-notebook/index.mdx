My reasoning and process for designing a custom PCB for the Raspberry Pico microcontroller



# Reasoning


For certain components in my capstone project, I would need to be able to detect whenever an object was taken off the desk display. After looking at some of the possible methods, the method I ended up settling on was using magnets for the detecting method. The way it would work was by having a magnet sensor in the back of the desk with a magnet on the other side of it. I would then also attach a magnet on the object, so when the object's magnet connected to the desk magnet, the magnet sensor behind it would sense the change and could shift the desks theme to correspond with the object. Using this method for detection allowed for wireless and more seamless methods for quickly switching between object themes.


Initially, to test out this method, I used one TLV493D magnetometer from Adafruit and the RP2040 QT PY board, which had a STEMMA QT port. This was to just test the feasibility of this method so all the microcontroller was programmed to do was to turn on its LED to green whenever a magnet was close by. After this test was performed, I decided this method would work and started to look into what would be needed to scale this up for the capstone project.


While this method would work great for the capstone project, some issues quickly became apparent. The first was the limitations with the magnetometers I2C addressing capitalize. With I2C devices, you are able to connect as many of them into a microcontroller as you can, as long as they don't have the same address, which in this case for the magnetometer was 0x5E. Some I2C sensors support the ability to change the address by soldering a jumper. The TLV493D did not have this ability, and even if it did, it wouldn't scale up once we add more than the supported address changes.




# Solution Brainstorming


To start off, I checked the available multiplexer devices that Adafruit and Sparkfun had on their store to see if they could work for the project. What I was looking for was a nice and compact MCU that had multiplexer and WiFi capabilities. With these requirements, I wasn't going to find something like this, so I was going to see if the boards with STEMMA connectors would be compact enough with a microcontroller that supports WiFi, such as the FeatherS2.

While this fixed the problem of connecting the magnetometers into the microcontroller, two issues arose from this design.


### Size
While the size of the multiplexer and microcontroller were small, when they were combined together, the footprint was unnecessarily big; the microcontroller would be connected to the multiplexer via the master STEMMA/QWIIC port, which meant the setup was either going to be long horizontally or vertically. Due to this increased size footprint, placing the magnetometers in the places I wanted to was very awkward or, at times, not possible. Another thing I needed to consider is how it would look if someone were to look at the back of the desk, which is where the microcontroller and multiplexer would be at. I didn't want the backside to look like a mess of wires and that reeks of 'simple prototype, will come up with a final design later' look.


### ESP32 VS RP2040
For this ubiquitous desk component of the project, I decided on using the Raspberry Pi Pico W as the standard microcontroller. The reason for this was due to the versatility and price of the Pico W; there wasn't a microcontroller that could do and connect to nearly anything with WiFi at the price of around $6. The obvious downsides of this versatile microcontroller is that it lacked the features that a board sold from Adafruit for example, a STEMMA port, built-in Neopixel, etc. This meant that if I wanted to use a Pico W as the board the communicates with the magnetometers, I would need to instead solder on wires to both the Pico W and multiplexer, which would even further increase the size footprint, and ruin the aesthetics in the backside of the desk. Another issue that arises from splitting the multiplexer microcontroller from the RP2040 is the slight variations on WiFi and MQTT connections. Instead of using the same setup for handling the connection to the WiFi and MQTT broker on the Pico Ws on the desk, I would need to maintain a separate version of the ESP32. Later down the line could become an issue for debugging problems with the connections to the MQTT, and especially the MQTT broker as I noticed they have little differences between how they receive and publish messages.


With these issues, I decided to look and research further into a possible solution or better alternative.




# Initial Research for Custom RPI Breakout Multiplexer PCB


This is when I started to explore the idea of creating a custom breakout PCB for the Pico W. This would be a serious undertaking, and possibly overshadowing the original project. So I started to research the benefits and possible issues/roadblocks I could run into if I go down this path.




### First PCB
I would be concepting, designing and testing my first ever PCB whilst a senior in high school. This would provide me some serious experience early on as I pursue a career in electrical engineering. The experience of having a circuit not just be a bunch of wires connected through a breadboard, but instead be a real circuit board has already been a dream of mine. This came with its obvious issues. Since this was my first PCB, there were going to be some learning-pains and roadblocks that I was going to run into. I also needed to keep in mind possible time-constraints, as I would the design to continue working on the project.




### Flexibility and Control
By creating my own custom PCB for the multiplexer, I could decide what design components I would want that other multiplexer boards had, and what parts I could scrap as I wouldn't need them for the project. This also gave me the ability to add components to the Raspberry Pico that it otherwise wouldn't have, such as a built-in Neopixel. This, however, meant that I would need to handle things that I previously didn't need to handle; it wasn't going to be plug and play as the already made multiplexers from Adafruit and SparkFun.




### Ascetics and Size Footprint
Having a custom PCB operating the magnetometers would be more impressive than using a bought board. This also allowed me to make the multiplexer more compact than the other two on the market as I could integrate the Pico W directly into the PCB, which is discussed later in the notebook in how I went about this.




### Conclusion of Research
After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to go ahead with the creating the PCB design for a custom multiplexer design for the Raspberry Pico W.






# Initial PCB Design Concepting
Now that I had concluded that I was going to create the PCB, I needed to set out what I would want to include with this breakout multiplexer PCB design. This also meant looking at any of the other multiplexer boards out in the market, which were manufactured and sold by Adafruit and SparkFun. In the end of the research of both these multiplexer boards, I would want to only use one of these boards as reference for the future as to avoid conflicting practices/methods of using the multiplexer. In the end, this ended up being the multiplexer sold by Adafruit.






### Using the Raspberry Pi Pico as a Base
The multiplexer PCB that I will design will use the Raspberry Pi Pico W as a base. The reason for this is the previous reasons meantined of the Pico already being the standard board used in the project, but another reason is that it would allow me to the built-in WiFi capabilities of the Pico W. If I were to add my own RP2040 chip to the PCB, I would also need to add back in the missing WiFi capabilities in the PCB. By doing this, the price of this would be more than just using a Pico W. For these reasons, I settled on this method of the PCB being a breakout multiplexer board for Pico W.






### I2C Pinouts or STEMMA/QWIIC Connectors?
One design choice that I wanted to keep from the Adafruit multiplexer was the STEMMA QT connectors. Since this whole project's goal was to make it easier and lower the amount of spaghetti cables going around, using the STEMMA QT ports would be the best choice. One thing with the naming scheme of STEMMA QT ports. SparkFun has their own version of these connectors, QWIIC, that are nearly identical. The one difference they do share is the voltage they are designed to be used for; STEMMA QT is designed for 3.3V and 5V, while QWIIC is only designed for 3.3V. For the sake of remaining consistent, I will be referring to them as STEMMA/QWIIC ports since this whole PCB is most similar to the Adafruit one, but these ports are more like QWIIC variants.




### Extra Peripherals
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a pretty barebones microcontroller compared to the other boards on the market; That's mostly up by the cheap price of it. With this breakout board, I could expand some of the capabilities of the board that I thought it would benefit from. This led to adding two peripherals alongside the multiplexer. First was the SD card reader. The reason for adding an SD card reader was that a lot of the time with I2C sensors, you want to keep the history of the readings somewhere. While for my capstone project, I planned to store this data somewhere else via the WiFi and a MQTT broker, this SD card reader would allow the non-WiFi version of the Pico to store the I2C sensor data somewhere, and still allow me to store the sensor data somewhere if the WiFi connection were to ever get interrupted. The second addition was a Neopixel. This addition was just a simple QoL one, in case I ever needed something more than just the green LED that the Pico had, such as MQTT connection status indicator. 






### Notable Differences between other Multiplexer Boards
While this board shares the same connection method to connect to the I2C devices, that's where it mostly ends. The other multiplexer boards often have another STEMMA/QWIIC port, or pinouts, to connect a microcontroller to the breakout board. With the Pico being attached to the breakout board directly through being soldered or with headers, these were redundant and not needed. Another removal was the ability to level shift all the ports to 3V. Due to the Pico already being a 3.3V microcontroller, having the ability to level shift would have not been needed.
